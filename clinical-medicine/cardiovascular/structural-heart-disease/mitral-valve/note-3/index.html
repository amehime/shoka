The posterior leaflet may be retracted and infiltrated with calcification, affecting coaptation with the anterior leaflet. While not an absolute contraindication, measuring the gradient is the first step in such cases. The coaptation gap may be long, indicating a more complex situation than a straightforward P2 prolapse. However, the three-chamber view suggests that TEER may still be suitable.

It is very unpredictable what will happen to those indentations when you put an edge-to-edge device in because sometimes they will close, but sometimes you will open them and make the situation worse.</p><blockquote><p>This document discusses key questions and considerations for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in mitral valve intervention. It highlights the importance of identifying the areas with the most significant regurgitant jet and the potential impact of tethering of the chordal. The document also mentions the strategy for functional MR and the use of two clip or two device strategy for wide jets. It emphasizes the need to improve hemodynamics and reduce regurgitation volume. Additionally, it cautions about the unpredictability of indentations when using an edge-to-edge device.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文讨论了二尖瓣经导管缘对缘修复术的关键问题和考虑因素。它强调了识别最显著的反流区域以及腱索拴系的潜在影响的重要性。文中还提到了功能性二尖瓣关闭不全的策略以及广泛反流的两个夹子或两个装置策略的使用。它强调了改善血流动力学和减少反流量的需求。此外，它提醒在使用缘对缘装置时，压痕的不可预测性。</p></blockquote><p>why do we go in the middle, let's recap all that you said.</p><p>First of all, because in this area, there is no tissue to grasp very short number two, because these areas, if I show you what is behind, below this clefts whatever, you have a lot of chords, you get entangled number three</p><p>because if you go in the A 2 P 2 region is the longest portion of the leaf. This is where the leaflets are the longest because leaflets are triangular. So the center is very long and you're not stealing leaflet surface for coaptation.</p><p>And finally, because you work in the chord-free zone.</p><p>So if you have no effect, you can easily retrieve and start from scratch.</p><p>There are so many reasons to go in the middle.</p><p>I think there is only one case in which you will open the indentations, the folds, and each type of P2, and that will be atrial secondary MR rather than ventricular secondary. When the leaflets are already unfolded, stretched thinned pencils delineated, so they barely reach each other and if you put the clips in the center, you might open up the indentations. Otherwise, the regurgitation will just get better.</p><p>我认为只有一种情况会打开缝隙、褶皱和各种 P2，那就是心房继发性二尖瓣反流而不是心室继发性。当瓣叶已经展开，拉伸细长时，它们几乎无法彼此接触，如果你把夹子放在中间，你可能会打开压痕。否则，反流只会变得更好。</p><p>the papillary muscle can be symmetric or can be asymmetric.</p></li></ol><h1 id="transseptal-puncture"><a class="anchor" href="#transseptal-puncture">#</a> Transseptal puncture</h1><p>we all know that the fossa ovalis is the area we want to achieve, is the only safe area, and is the only area where there is nothing other than the right and left atrium. if we puncture the fossa, we are in a safe place to orient ourselves.</p><p>Safe introduction of the large delivery system<br>Coaxial orientation of the delivery system to the long axis of the heart<br>Appropriate distance of the transeptal GC from the aorta to avoid aortic hugging<br>Appropriate height to enable efficient handling and grasping</p><p>安全引入大型输送系统<br>将输送系统的同轴方向与心脏的长轴对齐<br>使穿刺房间隔与主动脉保持一定距离，避免主动脉拥抱<br>适当的高度以实现有效的操作和抓握能力</p><p>Today we have devices that allow us to play around, but the more curves you add to your delivery system, the more complexity you add to your procedure, And the less predictability of the trajectory of devices.</p><p>if you are too close to the aorta, you are not at all above the line of coaptation.

The skull comes into the left atrium in an elongated fashion. So you need to rotate, the knob to close it.</p><p>其次，由于可操控导管和导引导管未固定在彼此内部，因此您需要进行弯曲和伸直导引导管的操作，以验证弯曲平面的同轴性，该平面需要与二尖瓣环平行。</p><p>Since the steerable catheter and the guiding catheter are not fixed one inside the other, you need to do this maneuver of flexing and unflexing the guiding to verify the coaxially of the flexing plane which needs to be parallel with the mitral valve annulus.</p><p>如果想做的更快一些， If you want to be quick, you can do it Also Fluoroscopically.</p><p>turn your c-arm to 30 CRA so that you see your perpendicular mitral valve plane, and you flex and you verify that you do not lose or gain height with the tip of your device with regard to the mitral valve plane.</p><p>将 C 形臂旋转到 30CRA，这样您就可以看到垂直的二尖瓣平面，您可以 flex，并且可以验证尖端不会失去或增加相对于二尖瓣平面的高度。</p><p>2ch 下看到（垂直的）二尖瓣平面，在这个体位上 flex，确定不会有高度增加或丧失。</p><p>也可以 skip 这个步骤</p><p>然后需要 steer towards the MV 转向 MV</p><p>主要是在 fluoroscopy 下， It's done by rotating the steerable knob on the Pascal system and retracting a little bit the whole assembly to clear the ridge. Pascal 系通过 steerable knob，以及整体回撤一点，以过华法林脊。</p><p>If you are with a mitral clip device you rotate the M knob on this handle over here, and you need to check on echo. 如果是 MC，则旋转 M 旋钮，配合超声。</p><p>定位和找方向</p><p>you need to identify the location where your clip needs to be placed.</p><p>you basically can be above the target jet.</p><p>And for this step, again, it's useful to have echo guidance. it's mandatory.</p><p>I'd say you need to have an X-plane with an inter-commissural view and an LVOT view, and you can adjust the trajectory and the location of your device accordingly. it's important to have two orthogonal images to identify a precise direction in all directions.</p><p>调整 orientation</p><p>不同病变位置，不同夹臂方向</p><p>对于 MC 来说，抖动释放内管张力， to transmit effectively the movement to the implant you might wanna dissipate the tension by advancing and retracting with very short movements.</p><p>对于 PASCAL 系统，内管转 60 度，中管需反向转 15-20 度补偿。if you want to rotate a Pascal system, you need to act on the implant catheter over here, and you need to counteract on the steerable catheter. So if you rotate the implant by 60 degrees, you might wanna rotate the steerable in an opposite direction for 15 to 20 degrees, just to give you an idea of how much the compensation is.</p><p>垂直、位置、夹臂方向都 ok 了，推内管，跨二尖瓣</p><p>送入心室的深度，基本就是正好在瓣叶下，两个瓣叶都能自由活动 you basically can stop once your device is exactly below both leaflets And you see both leaflets moving.</p><p>可以回撤系统，再次之前跨瓣后用 3D 再次检查一下夹臂方向有没有偏转也是很有用的。Now you need to retract your device. it's also useful to check on 3D that you did not lose your clocking after crossing the mitral valve.</p><p>you need to retract your clip device until you have both leaflets, which are engaged. And until you see both leaflets nicely bouncing in above the clip arms.</p><p>Again here there is a little bit of difference between the two devices. The <strong>Pascal device</strong> once its arm opens <strong>180 degrees</strong>, whereas with the <strong>MitraClip</strong>, usually we <strong>give 120 degrees</strong> of opening to both leaflets.</p><p>also with the MitraClip, you might wanna have a grasping, which is not as high as you might want with the Pascal system.</p><p>After both leaflets are engaged, and the clips or the clasps are down, you're ready to close the implant. And to evaluate for leaflet insertion</p><p>you need to evaluate in different echo views.</p><p>LVOT view is critical.</p><p>You should see both leaflets coming in with a nice v-shape in the clip system.</p><h2 id="discussion-3"><a class="anchor" href="#discussion-3">#</a> Discussion</h2><p>if I lose clocking as I cross the leaflets.
